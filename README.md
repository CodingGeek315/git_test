This is the second file of README.md.

# git_test
Need to fix this correctly, just adding this in to suffice for "Practicing GIT Basics" - will updated correctly later when I figured out the issue going on
TIL - How to setup some things in GITHUB however I am stuck trying to find my local files, I'm unsure how to write the command line to get that.  I checked Odin Project chat and that didn't seem to help.  Scott, who is editing this, was also stuck as he sucks with GitHub.

# Things I need to do
Find local copy of git_test on my computer
 -Need to ask Dad on that
Finish out rest of Git Basics Project
 -will do later on today and/or Sunday
